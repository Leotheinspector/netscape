    <h1>Leo Rojas</h1>

    <p>
      This site is a small collection of working proofs of concept I’ve built to explore how
      modern technologies — including AI — can be applied in practical, responsible ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an engineering and software quality leader, I use projects like these to understand
      new tools end to end before asking teams to adopt them. Rather than starting with theory
      or vendor claims, I prefer to validate ideas by building something real, even if it’s
      intentionally simple.
    </p>

    <p>Each project on this site is designed to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Explore a specific technical pattern or capability</li>
      <li>Reduce ambiguity around new technologies</li>
      <li>Serve as a concrete example I can use to guide and inspire teams</li>
      <li>Demonstrate how small, focused proofs of concept can lead to better decisions at scale</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The emphasis here is not polish or completeness — it’s clarity, learning, and leadership
      through execution.
    </p>

        Netscape
      </a>
      — A lightweight proof of concept exploring how large language models can be integrated
      into applications via API.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://tipcalculator.leorojas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Tip Splitter
      </a>
      — A small application demonstrating how clear business rules and AI-assisted development
      can be used to build practical internal tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each project includes a short case study describing the architecture, intent, and how
      similar patterns could be applied by an engineering or SQA team in a real organization.
